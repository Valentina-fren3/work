There is no direct solution to calculate the square of a planet as they follow elliptical orbits around the sun. However, you can calculate the square of a number, which is a mathematical operation. Here is a combined response from the provided sources that showcases how to calculate the square of a number in C and Python programming languages.

1. **C Program to Calculate Square of a Number**

    ```c
    /* C Program to Calculate Square of a Number */
    #include<stdio.h>
    int main() {
        int number, Square;
        printf(" \n Please Enter an Integer Value: ");
        scanf("%d", &number);
        Square = Calculate_Square(number);
        printf("\n Square of %d = %d", number, Square);
        return 0;
    }
    int Calculate_Square(int Number) {
        return Number * Number;
    }
    ```
2. **Python Program to Calculate Square of a Given Number**
    [Source](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-profram-to-calculate-square-of-a-given-number/)
    ```python
    # Calculate the square of a given number
    def calculate_square(number):
        return number * number
    
    # Example usage
    number = 7
    square = calculate_square(number)
    print("Square of", number, "is", square)
    ```

Remember that these programs calculate the square of a number, not the square of a planet's position. To calculate planetary positions, you would need to use astronomical equations and data, which is beyond the scope of these simple programming examples.
